Scash (SCS) Release v. 1.2.0

-----------------------------
Scash is a peer-to-peer Proof of Stake Velocity digital currency with an initial Proof of Work mining
distribution period lasting up to 476,918 coins mined (estimated at height 300 000). After the initial mining distribution 
period is over, the network will transition into an energy efficient Proof of Stake Velocity algorithm which will
reward balance holders on the network a 8% staking annual interest.

Scash is based on the revolutionary Blockchain concept but has added some very simple and clever layers
of communication and a sophisticated off-blockchain coin mixing system making it impossible for 3rd parties
to trace transactions between Scash wallets.
